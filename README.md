# To-Do-List
## This project shows the changes I have made to the starter files given.

## Description
### You can add new tasks on the to do list by typing them in the bottom box. Push enter and they will be added. Delete list items by clicking on the (-). The background is plum and the text is light green. I outlined the header in black. The Add Todo... box is also light green. I moved the to do list to the middle of the page, directly under the header.

## How to run it.
### You must download the zip file. Then open up the CSS, javascript, and html file last. 

## Furture Improvements
### I'd like to try and figure out how to add things to the background, besides just changing the color.
